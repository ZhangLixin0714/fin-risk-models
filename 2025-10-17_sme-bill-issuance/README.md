# SME Trade Bill Issuance ‚Äî Monitoring Model

üìÖ **Date:** 2025-10-17  
üìÇ **Category:** Small Business Credit / Short-term Financing  
üéØ **Use case:** Detect small- and micro-enterprise clients that rely heavily on **trade bill issuance** (banker‚Äôs acceptances or commercial bills), signaling potential liquidity stress or disguised borrowing.

---

## üß† Objective
Analyze issuance activity of **small and micro enterprises (SMEs)** within a defined observation period to:
- Identify clients issuing unusually large or frequent bills relative to their credit lines;
- Flag entities that may be using bills as a substitute for direct loans;
- Support branch-level early-warning and risk concentration monitoring.

---

## üîç Detection Logic
1. Extract all trade bills issued by SME clients within the observation window.  
2. Aggregate by company / branch / industry.  
3. Compute metrics:  
   - `total_bill_amount`, `bill_count`, `avg_tenor_days`  
   - `bill_to_loan_ratio` = total_bill_amount / total_loans  
   - `yoy_growth` vs. previous period  
4. Flag if:  
   - `bill_to_loan_ratio` > `:RATIO_LIMIT`, or  
   - `growth_rate` > `:GROWTH_THRESHOLD`, or  
   - `total_bill_amount` > `:AMOUNT_LIMIT`.
